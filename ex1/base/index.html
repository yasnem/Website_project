						Lara is a freelance web designer with satisfied clients worldwide. Lara has been designing websites professionally for over eight years, and is very keen on personal service. I would describe Lara as a spiritual fast learning generalist with a passion for remarkable design.

						At first I intended to be an animator and went to design school fully motivated to become just that. One thing led to another and 2 years went by and I was a (almost) fully fledged freelance web designer without ever planning to become one.
